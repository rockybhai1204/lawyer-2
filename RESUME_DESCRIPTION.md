# Legal Consultancy Platform - Resume Project Description

## Project Description (ATS-Friendly)

**Full-Stack Legal Consultancy Platform | Next.js, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL**

Developed and deployed a comprehensive full-stack web application for legal consultancy services, enabling clients to purchase legal services, schedule consultations, and manage cases through an intuitive admin dashboard. Built with modern web technologies and best practices for scalability, performance, and user experience.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

• **Frontend Development**: Architected responsive user interface using Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript, implementing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO. Utilized TailwindCSS for utility-first styling and Radix UI components for accessible, customizable UI elements.

• **Dynamic Form Builder**: Designed and implemented a custom form builder system with conditional logic, allowing administrators to create dynamic forms with field dependencies and validation rules. Integrated React Hook Form with Zod schema validation for type-safe form handling and client-side validation.

• **Payment Integration**: Integrated PhonePe payment gateway with secure webhook handling, implementing payment initiation, callback processing, and transaction status management. Built comprehensive payment audit logging system for financial tracking and reconciliation.

• **Cloud Storage Integration**: Implemented AWS S3 integration for secure document upload and storage, including pre-signed URL generation for direct client-side uploads, reducing server load and improving upload performance.

• **Real-Time Communication**: Integrated Twilio API for WhatsApp notifications and video conferencing, enabling automated meeting link generation, template-based messaging, and real-time communication between clients and lawyers.

• **Database Design & ORM**: Designed normalized PostgreSQL database schema using Prisma ORM, implementing complex relationships between services, cases, lawyers, forms, and payments. Utilized Prisma's type-safe queries and migrations for database management.

• **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented secure authentication system using NextAuth.js with JWT-based sessions, role-based access control (RBAC) for admin, lawyer, and client roles, and protected API routes using middleware.

• **State Management**: Implemented Zustand for global state management, ensuring type-safe state updates and efficient component re-rendering across the application.

• **API Development**: Built RESTful API endpoints using Next.js API routes with TypeScript, implementing unified type definitions for request/response validation, error handling, and consistent API responses.

• **Admin Dashboard**: Developed comprehensive admin panel with features including service management, case assignment, lawyer approval workflow, payment tracking, and analytics dashboard with data visualization using Recharts.

• **Type Safety**: Maintained end-to-end type safety using TypeScript, creating shared type definitions between frontend and backend, and leveraging Prisma-generated types for database operations.

• **Performance Optimization**: Implemented code splitting, lazy loading, and optimized bundle sizes. Utilized Next.js Image component for optimized image delivery and implemented efficient data fetching strategies.

• **UI/UX Design**: Created modern, accessible user interface with smooth animations using Framer Motion, implemented responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, and ensured WCAG accessibility standards compliance.

**Technologies**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js, AWS S3, Twilio API, PhonePe SDK, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, Radix UI, Framer Motion, Node.js
