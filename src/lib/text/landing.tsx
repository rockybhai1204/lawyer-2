    whyText:
      "Most people hesitate to approach a lawyer, because of two main reasons: 1. Lack of trust, and 2. Lack of convenience. Traditional legal services often involve long queues, multiple visits to offices, and uncertainty about fees or outcomes. At the same time, the risk of using unverified templates or unqualified agents can lead to disputes, invalid documents, or even financial losses.",
